## `Developers and Contributors`

### `Requirements`

To contribute to development, you will need to download and install the required software first.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/preview/)

### `Cloning Source Code`

Next, you need to get the source code.  This source code repository uses git submodules. So when you clone the source code, you will need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Furtif/MediaNavIGO.git
```

Or if you already cloned without the recursive option, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Furtif/MediaNavIGO.git
cd MediaNavIGO
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
